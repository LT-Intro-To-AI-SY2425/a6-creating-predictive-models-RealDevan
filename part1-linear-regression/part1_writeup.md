# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
R squared is the correlation, this shows how correlated the data is. The higher the value the more correlated.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
136.52
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this model is semi-accurate because the correlation value is not that strong but also not that weak. To make the correllation stronger, we should add more data.
