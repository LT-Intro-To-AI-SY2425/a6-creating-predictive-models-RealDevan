# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the model I created in the previous lesson because this models tests the model by looping through all of the values in the xtest dataset. This way the figure is capable of showing the training and testing data as well as the data provided.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squard coeffecient tells me that this model is moderately positively strong at 0.6398. So, the data has some correlation but not extremely strong correlation.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that this model is somewhat accurate because the predicted and actual value difference is lower than the previous model, meaning that this model is closer to full accuracy than the last model.
